	<h2> Managing a real stock portfolio since the beginning of 2017</h2>
	<p> The portfolio that the Investment Club is managing consists of different
	companies that belong to technology and science related industries. At NJIT we believe 
	that the only way of making good investment decisions is by knowing perfectly how 
	businesses work. Therefore, we only invest in the following sectors:
	<ul>
	<li><h3>Healthcare</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Technology</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Industrials</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Financial Services</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Energy</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Consumer</h3></li>
	<li><h3>Communication Services</h3></li>
