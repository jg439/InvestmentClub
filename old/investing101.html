						<h2> NJIT´s Training Program </h2>
						<p>Investing 101 is a 10-week training program created by the Investment Club with the collaboration of the
						School of Management where participants are introduced to the basics of investing. 
						At the end of the program, the students who wish to become analysts of the club will be able to take 
						a final exam where their abilities and skills will be measured. 
						Any current student of the school is welcome to join us and learn the club´s investment philosophy.
						Some of the material given in this class will be based on <i>The Five Rules for Succesful Stock Investing</i> by 
						Pat Dorsey.</p>
